## Research interests

The human brain manages integrate uncertain information in order to arrive at a 
course of action or some new [Erkenntnis] by integrating information from different 
sources.

We can recreate this approach with the Bayesian Inference framework, allowing us to have
a principled way to integrate informations when we have a good idea what the underlying
models are. 
This is especially important, under limited availability of data, and integration of 
uncertainty from different sources and our an uncertainty quantification of the 
results is essential. As such, as our work and from other groups have shown, Bayesian 
methods were essential during the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand the dynamics of such 
a novel disease.

However, Bayesian methods can be improved, in particular the inference part can be 
inefficient. My goal is to improve algorithms, in particular extend Hamiltonian Monte 
Carlo to more efficiently sample.... [Add add some outlook]
